# System_Calculation
Calculation of b-system in conversion to decimal, in Assembly.

## Install

git clone https://github.com/DimitrisRammos/System_Calculation

## Code
This program is the final exercise in lesson Computer Architecture I from my second half year, in https://www.di.uoa.gr/.
This work is in assembly.

## Exercise Pronunciation
Write a symbolic language program MIPS, which it will read an integer 2 <= b <= 10, or zero(0) for termination the program.
For any other number b, you have to print error message and ask for a number again.
When you read the number 2 <= b <= 10, the program to request a string from user, which must represent a valid number up to 5 digits, in the numbering system with base b.
If the input string isn't correct, the program to print error message and ask for a string again.

## MIPS Simulator

QtSpim is a Simulator MIPS. 

You can to download QtSpim [here.](https://sourceforge.net/projects/spimsimulator/files/)

After, you can to run my code there.
