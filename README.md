# System_Calculation
Calculation of b-system in conversion to decimal, in Assembly.

## Install

git clone https://github.com/DimitrisRammos/System_Calculation

## Code
This program is the final exercise in lesson Computer Architecture I from my second half year, in https://www.di.uoa.gr/.
This work is in assembly.

## Exercise Pronunciation
Write a symbolic language program MIPS, which it will read an integer 2 <= b <= 10, or zero(0) for termination the program.
For any other number b, you have to print error message and ask for a number again.
When you read the number 2 <= b <= 10, the program to request a string from user, which must represent a valid number up to 5 digits, in the numbering system with base b.
If the input string isn't correct, the program to print error message and ask for a string again.
If the input string is correct, than the program convert the number with base b, in demical numbering system and print this number in console.
This program repeated until the input number b is zero(0).

### For Example - input and output
Give base:

X

Wrong base; give again:

6

Give 5-digit number is base 6:

91347

Wrong number; give again:

12245

Number in demical is:

1829

Give base:





## MIPS Simulator

QtSpim is a Simulator MIPS. 

You can to download QtSpim [here.](https://sourceforge.net/projects/spimsimulator/files/)

After, you can to run my code there.
